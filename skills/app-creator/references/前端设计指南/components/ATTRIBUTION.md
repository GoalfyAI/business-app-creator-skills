# Attribution & upstream licenses

`components` is a **sourcing skill**. It ships *pointers* (registry commands), not component code.
When you use it, the real component is fetched live from the library below and is governed by **that
library's license**, not this repo's Apache-2.0 license. This file credits every upstream source.

| Library | Author / Project | License | License link |
|---------|------------------|---------|--------------|
| Aceternity UI | Manu Arora | Aceternity License: free to use in unlimited personal/commercial end products; cannot redistribute the component/source itself (as a stock asset, template, or marketplace item) | https://ui.aceternity.com/licence |
| Magic UI | Magic UI | MIT | https://github.com/magicuidesign/magicui/blob/main/LICENSE |
| Cult UI | Jordan Gilliam (nolly) | MIT | https://github.com/nolly-studio/cult-ui/blob/main/LICENSE.md |
| ReactBits | David Haz | MIT + Commons Clause: commercial use is fine as part of a product; you may not resell, sublicense, or redistribute the components themselves | https://github.com/DavidHDev/react-bits/blob/main/LICENSE.md |
| 21st.dev | 21st.dev community | **Per component - verify each** | https://21st.dev (check the component page) |

## Per-entry licenses
Every entry in `components.json` carries a `license` field. The `aceternity` entries confirm the
current terms of the Aceternity License (verified against ui.aceternity.com/licence, 2026-07-06):
free to use in unlimited personal/commercial end products, but the component/source itself may not
be redistributed (no reselling, templating, or marketplace listing of the Item). This is why
`components` stays pointer-only rather than vendoring a snapshot (see issue #4). The `21st.dev`
source has **no blanket license** - each component must be verified individually before shipping.
The six curated `21st.dev` entries are all MIT, verified against their upstream source repos
(KokonutUI for the `@kokonutd` components, cobe for `@shuding`'s globe), not just the 21st.dev page.

The nine `reactbits` entries carry `"MIT + Commons Clause"` (verified against
`DavidHDev/react-bits`' `LICENSE.md`, 2026-08-16; previously recorded here as plain `MIT`, which had
gone stale). Commons Clause restricts *reselling, sublicensing, or redistributing the components
themselves* (alone, bundled, or ported); it does not restrict ordinary commercial use of a product
built with them. `components` never redistributes the fetched source (pointer-only, same as the
Aceternity case above), so the restriction does not change what shipping through this skill is
allowed to do - only the label was wrong.

## Framework variants (`frameworks`)

A showpiece entry may carry an optional `frameworks` object (e.g. `frameworks.vue`) for a non-React
port of the same effect, with its own `ref`/`library`/`license`/`deps` - the license notes above
apply to whichever variant was actually fetched, not just the top-level (React) one. The pilot entry
is `split-text` -> `frameworks.vue` -> **Vue Bits**' `SplitText`, verified end-to-end (real
`npx shadcn-vue@latest add`, real `vue-tsc -b && vite build`) 2026-08-16. See issue #13.
